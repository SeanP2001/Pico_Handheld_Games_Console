# Pico Handheld Games Console

## Introduction

I started this project to follow on from my [ATtiny Handheld Games Console](https://github.com/SeanP2001/ATtiny_Handheld_Games_Console). I decided the project was not as accessible as I wanted because programming an ATtiny is not simple enough for a beginner. I also found that while the limitations of the ATtiny make it a fun challenge to create games, it would be nice to be able to make something more elaborate.

## Brief

I wanted to make a USB-programmable games console which could be programmed using either MicroPython or C++. I also wanted to use silicone button membranes to give the buttons a more premium feel compared to the tactile buttons on the ATtiny console. Partway into this project, I decided I wanted to use a colour TFT display.
